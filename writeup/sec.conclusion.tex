\section{Conclusion}

\textbf{Problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Models that are not formulated in plate notation would either need to be converted to it or the ERM needs to be obtained in a different way.
\item framework needs to be updated when new implementations are released
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Extensions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item implement framework
\item translate more models
\item analyze different types of models (not only unsupervised)
\end{itemize}
