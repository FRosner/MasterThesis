\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Statistical model formulation often flat (graphical models)
\item Data model is structured / hierarchical / relational
\item Input data heavily depend on application (text, gene, geo, images, ...)\\
$\Rightarrow$ how to analyze them?
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Develop custom statistical model that makes use of all available features\\
	$\Rightarrow$ machine learning expert needed
	\item Use pre-built standard model (clustering, topic models, HMM, ...)\\
	$\Rightarrow$ meta data needs to be joined with the inference algorithm results\\
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Contribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data model driven architecture (framework) for rapid machine learning application development
\item Translation rules to incorporate new models into the framework
\end{itemize}
