\section{Machine Learning Applications}

\subsection{Typical Architecture}

\textbf{Machine learning application architecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are data and a problem that needs to be solved (explorative analysis, hypothesis testing, ...)
\item Select a statistical model and a corresponding implementation
\item Get the inferred variables from the inference algorithm
\item Enrich given data with inference results
\item Gain insight by performing analysis on the enriched data
\item Visualize results
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Roles}
\begin{itemize}
\item Traditional roles
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Domain expert (provides data, does hypothesis testing using analysis result and visualization)
	\item Machine learning scientist (provides inference algorithm, data analysis, transformation and visualization)
	\end{itemize}
	$\Rightarrow$ Problem: Machine learning scientists are rare and expensive
\item Solution: New roles
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Domain expert (provides data, does hypothesis testing using analysis result and visualization)
	\item Application programmer (uses standard inference algorithm implementation, can perform arbitrary analysis on data and inference results using simple queries, provides visualization)
	\end{itemize}
	$\Rightarrow$ Machine learning scientist provides standard inference algorithm implementations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Challenges}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(A)] Data needs to be converted to the required inference algorithm input format
	\begin{description}
	\item[Traditional solution] Consult the documentation of the inference algorithm implementation and convert the data into the required input format
	\item[New solution] Conversion under the hood given the matched data model because the implementation is known
	\end{description}
\item[(B)] Optimized implementations may not explicitly calculate all missing variables
	\begin{description}
	\item[Traditional solution] Manually calculating the missing values and distributions
	\item[New solution] Application of sum-product and max-sum algorithm on the given results and the model
	\end{description}
\item[(C)] Integration of given data and inference results
	\begin{description}
	\item[Traditional solution] Consult the documentation of the inference algorithm output format, understand it and load it back to your original data integrating it manually
	\item[New solution] Data integration by model integration: match the statistical model and the model of the given data so that integration is just a matter of writing data corresponding to the combined schema. Output format is known by the framework developer.
	\end{description}
\item[(D)] Analysis of data having partly probabilistic relationships (common queries)
	\begin{description}
	\item[Traditional solution] Calculating group-by aggregations, filters and transformations (sometimes representing computing marginals on filtered data $\rightarrow$ normalization required)
	\item[New solution] POLAP offering common transformation operations on entities and normal or probabilistic relationships.
	\end{description}
