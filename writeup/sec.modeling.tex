\subsection{Directed Graphical Models}

\textbf{Plate models}
\begin{itemize}
\item developed by \textcite{buntine1994operations} / \textcite{gilks1994language}, now common in graphical models ([CITATION NEEDED] for graphical models, esp. baysian networks)
\item variables = circles
\item dependencies = arrows / independence assumptions = lack of arrows
\item repeated variables = plates
\item shaded circles = observed variables [CITATION NEEDED (Bishop?)]
\item small dark circles = parameters [CITATION NEEDED (Bishop?)]
\end{itemize}
