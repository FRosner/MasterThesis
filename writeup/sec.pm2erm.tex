\section{Translation of Plate Models to Entity Relationship Models}

\textbf{Translation procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item make constraints explicit
\item remove variable dependencies (arrows)
\item convert vector variables to atomic ones
\item translate this atomic plate model (APM) to an entity relationship model (ERM)
\item adjust cardinalities and weak relationships of observed variables according to the given constraints (optional)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{APM $\Rightarrow$ ERM}
\begin{itemize}
\item variables $\Rightarrow$ attributes\footnote{Variables that are not inside of a plate need to be assigned to an artificial entity type called "Global" [CITATION NEEDED].}
\item plates $\Rightarrow$ entity types
\item plate intersections $\Rightarrow$ relationships (association entitites)\\
	(plates that are covered completely will have (1,1) cardinality to the association entity)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observed variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Observed multinomial variables $x \in \{0,1\}$ with a constraint over the domain $V$, e.g. $\sum_{v \in V} x_v = 1,$ that are association entity attributes affect the relation between this association entity and the entity type of $V$. By observing them the relationship is not weak anymore and the observed variable can be removed as an attribute.
\end{itemize}
